<h1 id="toc_0">Method Essentials</h1>

<p>In our basic lesson on <a href="../../../v2/course_content/outputs/control_and_functions.html">control and functions</a>, we learned that a function or method needs zero or more argument and has a single return value.</p>

<p>More strictly speaking, if we look at how methods work in other languages, they actually require something slightly different:</p>

<ul>
<li>A scope</li>
<li>A <em>call stack</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The input arguments and the return value are both optional, in general; this is true in Ruby as well, though strictly speaking, Ruby methods always return a value even when you don&rsquo;t use the <code>return</code> keyword, because the return value of a function is the value of the last evaluated expression.</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">Understanding Scope</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by understanding what the <code>scope</code> of a method is. At all times in your application, Ruby has to keep track of the values of all the variables and symbols you have used. For example, in this code snippet:</p>
<div class=mycode>
def&nbsp;say_hello(name)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts&nbsp;"hello&nbsp;#{name}"<br/>
end<br/>
name='megan'<br/>
say_hello("joe")<br/>
<span style='color: blue'>'hello&nbsp;joe'&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<p>How does Ruby keep track that <code>say_hello</code> is a method? Why does the method <code>say_hello</code> not use the value assigned to <code>name</code> outside it, and print <code>hello megan</code> instead?</p>

<p>Ruby (like all programming languages) does book-keeping along the way, with some rules that are specific to it, that help it record what the value or meaning of each symbol is. This ongoing record is called the <strong>scope</strong>.</p>

<p>Note that there is a difference in Ruby  between &ldquo;being in scope&rdquo; and &ldquo;being defined in the scope&rdquo;: the scope of a program will contain all variables names that are going to be defined but they won&rsquo;t actually be marked as defined until they are first encountered.</p>

<p>In the snippet above, Ruby will keep the scope inside the method distinct from the scope outside it, which is why you can have the same variable in two places without getting their values confused.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Knowing What&rsquo;s In Scope</h2>

<p>Ruby lets you inspect the current scope while the program is running, through a variety of methods that&rsquo;re part of the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/">Ruby core library</a>. We&rsquo;ll start with a method that lists the local variables that are known to Ruby:</p>
<div class=mycode>
def&nbsp;say_hello(name)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts&nbsp;"Inside&nbsp;the&nbsp;method,&nbsp;the&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are&nbsp;#{local_variables}"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts&nbsp;"hello&nbsp;#{name}"<br/>
assigned_later=1<br/>
end<br/>
name='megan'<br/>
address='123&nbsp;Main&nbsp;St.'<br/>
puts&nbsp;"Outside&nbsp;the&nbsp;method,&nbsp;the&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are&nbsp;#{local_variables}"<br/>
say_hello<br/>
puts&nbsp;"Outside&nbsp;the&nbsp;method,&nbsp;the&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are&nbsp;#{local_variables}"<br/>
<span style='color: blue'>Outside&nbsp;the&nbsp;method,&nbsp;the&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are&nbsp;[:name,&nbsp;:address]</span><br/>
<span style='color: blue'>Inside&nbsp;the&nbsp;method&nbsp;now,&nbsp;the&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are&nbsp;[:name,&nbsp;:assigned_later]</span><br/>
<span style='color: blue'>Outside&nbsp;the&nbsp;method,&nbsp;the&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are&nbsp;[:name,&nbsp;:address]</span><br/>
<span style='color: blue'>hello&nbsp;joe</span>
</div>

<p>This shows how Ruby changes the scope when it is executing inside the method - <code>:address</code> is no longer listed as a local variable while control is inside the method, but will be listed again when you return to the scope outside the method.</p>

<h1 id="toc_3">Something&rsquo;s Bound To Happen</h1>

<p>The specific values that are assigned to the variables when they are
defined, within a given scope, constitute a <em>binding</em>. Intuitively
enough, to know what the value of a given variable is, you have to use the <code>binding</code> method.</p>

<p>The method cannot output the value by itself - in order to do so, you have to tell Ruby to actually perform an expression evaluation, using that binding:</p>
<div class=mycode>
a=1<br/>
puts&nbsp;"The&nbsp;local&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are:&nbsp;#{local_variables}"<br/>
value_a&nbsp;=&nbsp;binding.eval("a")<br/>
puts&nbsp;"The&nbsp;value&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;is&nbsp;#{value_a}"<br/>
<span style='color: blue'>The&nbsp;local&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are:&nbsp;[:_,&nbsp;:a]</span><br/>
<span style='color: blue'>The&nbsp;value&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;is&nbsp;1</span>
</div>

<p>This is a somewhat roundabout way of obtaining the value of a variable - after all, you could have just printed it out like so - <code>puts &amp;ldquo;#{a}&amp;rdquo;</code> - so this is just to illustrate how binding works. To get a better sense of why it&rsquo;s helpful, let&rsquo;s look at the code in snippets <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, and <strong>3</strong>.</p>
