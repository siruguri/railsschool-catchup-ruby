<p>Now that we understand scope and binding, blocks become a bit easier to understand.</p>

<p>The scope of a block is created by combining its scope along with the scope <em>in which it is defined</em>:</p>

<p>sum=0
   mesg=&ldquo;Not in block&rdquo;
   list=[1,2,3]
   list.each { |item| mesg=&ldquo;In block&rdquo;; puts mesg; sum += item }
   puts sum</p>
