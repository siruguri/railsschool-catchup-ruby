<h1>Naming Data</h1>

<p>To refer to pieces of data, programming languages use <em>variables</em>, which is the word for the names we give to data.</p>

<p>Most programming languages will have &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; support for a couple of simple data types, like integers and strings of text. They will also have a way to manage collections of data.</p>

<h2>Simple Types in Ruby</h2>

<p>The simplest data types in Ruby are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Integers: Anything written as a number is assumed to be one, and you can perform most simple operations on them, for example, add, multiple, take the square of, and so on</p>
<div class=mycode>
a=3<br/>
b=a*2 <span style='color: red'># The value of the variable b will be 6</span>
</div></li>
<li><p>Text: Text is usually represented by enclosing it in double- or single-quotes. In Ruby, you can concatenate string together using the <code>+</code> symbol.</p>
<div class=mycode>
first_name="Bill"<br/>
last_name='Clinton'<br/>
full_name=first_name + last_name<br/>
<span style='color: red'># The value of the variable full_name will be "BillClinton"</span>
</div></li>
</ul>

<p>In these examples, you can see how variable values are substituted and
assigned. The variable that is assigned to is on the left side of the
<code>=</code> symbol. Ruby will start by reading the expression to the right of
the <code>=</code> and &ldquo;compute&rdquo; it - that is, substitute values for the variable
names, and perform whatever operation is requested.</p>

<p>Note also that, like in most languages, variable names follow certain rules in Ruby:</p>

<ul>
<li>They can&rsquo;t contain spaces.</li>
<li>They can&rsquo;t start with numbers.</li>
<li>They usually only have alphanumeric characters and the underscore (&ldquo;_&rdquo;) character. (Any other characters in a variable name means that the data will behave in certain special ways so avoid using those characters until you&rsquo;ve learned what these special behaviors are.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collections in Ruby</h2>

<p>Collections of data are simple ways of keeping related pieces of
information together, instead of having a new name for each one. For
example, if you have a roster of names that you are reading form a
file, then rather than have a separate variable for each name, you&rsquo;d
prefer to refer to them by a single variable that represents the
roster and then have them indexed by number.</p>

<p>There are two types of collections that are used in most languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Arrays: In Ruby, arrays are initialized using the <code>[ ]</code> symbol, like so:</p>
<div class=mycode>
names = ['Hillary', 'Bill', 'Clinton']<br/>
president1 = names[1] + names[2] <span style='color: red'># president1 will be 'BillClinton'</span><br/>
president2 = names[0] + names[2] <span style='color: red'># president2 will be 'HillaryClinton'</span>
</div></li>
<li><p>Hashes: Hashes are collections of <em>key/value pairs</em>. Each element in the hash is indexed by its key. In Ruby, hashes are initialized using the <code>{ }</code> symbol, like so:</p>
<div class=mycode>
clinton_family = {'mama-bear' => 'Hillary', 'papa-bear' => 'Bill'}<br/>
clinton_family['baby-bear'] = 'Chelsea'<br/>
clinton_family['last-name'] = 'Clinton'<br/>
president1 = clinton_family['papa-bear'] + clinton_family['last-name']<br/>
president2 = clinton_family['mama-bear'] + clinton_family['last-name']
</div></li>
</ul>

<p>Note how the initialization uses different symbols, but both <code>Hash</code>es
and <code>Array</code>s use the <code>[ ]</code> symbols to assign individual values.</p>
