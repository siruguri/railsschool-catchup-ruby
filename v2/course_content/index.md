# Ruby Courses

There are 3 courses so far. The attached code in [the repo that this material is stored on](https://github.com/siruguri/railsschool-catchup-ruby) is related to this material but I haven't had a chance to explain how, yet.

There are 3 courses:

* [An Introduction To Programming](introduction_to_programming.html)
* [Data And Variables](data_and_variables.html)
* [Control and Function](control_and_functions.html)
* [Object Oriented Programming in Ruby](object_oriented.html)

Have fun!
