<h1 id="toc_0">Orienting Around Objects: Data First</h1>

<p>The idea of object-oriented (or &ldquo;OO&rdquo;) programming is to focus on data
- that&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;object&rdquo; in OO refers to.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Methods In OO</h2>

<p>In OO, methods are &ldquo;attached&rdquo; to objects. The idea is that a function
doesn&rsquo;t float around on its own, it&rsquo;s instead always &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by a
specific piece of data, and it operates on the piece of data it&rsquo;s
attached to, or owned by.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">You&rsquo;ve Got A Type</h2>

<p>The other main idea in OO is that any piece of data has a type, which in OO programming is usually called the object&rsquo;s <em>class</em>.</p>

<p>Each class has a set of properties that is unique to itself. For example,
all numbers have the property that they have a sign, negative or
positive. </p>

<p>OO languages allow programmers to write their own types. You might
write a type called Animal, for example: all animals might have a
property called <code>number_of_legs</code>, say.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to distinguish between the properties of an object, and
the <em>values</em> of each property. All objects of the type Human Being
have the property <em>name</em>, but the value of that property is specific to
each object (each person, in this case.) </p>

<p>Specificity doesn&rsquo;t mean uniqueness. Even if my name happens to be
written the same way as yours, I can still change my name and yours
won&rsquo;t change with it - that&rsquo;s why my name is specific to me, even if
it&rsquo;s not unique.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">The Class Hierarchy</h2>

<p>Once you have classes, a key extension is that these classes are all
part of a <em>class hierarchy</em>. Each class inherits from another, which
is called its parent class. Class inheritance is a key notion in OO
programming, because many of the capabilities you get as a programmer
stem from understanding the various ways in which inheritance works. </p>

<p>If a type <strong>T</strong> <em>inherits</em> from another type <strong>S</strong>, it means that data
(an object) of type <strong>T</strong> will have all the properties that an object
of type <strong>S</strong> does, plus possibly more. The type <strong>Dog</strong> nherits from
the type <strong>Animal</strong> - this means that all Dogs are Animals, but all
Animals are not Dogs. Dogs will have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal#Characteristics">properties that are common to
all Animals</a>,
and will have properties additional to those that they share only with
other Dogs and with no other Animals.</p>

<p>There are some questions which come to mind immediately, that you should think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>If all classes have a parent, then doesn&rsquo;t that create an infinite chain of ancestry? How do you handle that?</li>
<li>Can a class have more than one parent, as things do in real-life? For example, the object representing Mickey Mouse is of the type Fictional Animal. It could have two parents (among others): Animals and Fictional Characters. How does that work?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_4">OO Programming in Ruby</h1>

<p>Ruby offers a number of &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; functions that help you investigate these concepts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>.class</code>: To any object, append <code>.class</code> and you&rsquo;ll get its class name.</p>
<div class=mycode>
puts&nbsp;"this&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;string".class<br/>
<span style='color: red'>#&nbsp;The&nbsp;output&nbsp;is&nbsp;String</span>
</div></li>
<li><p><code>.ancestors</code>: To any class name, append <code>.ancestors</code> and you&rsquo;ll see the hierarchy it belongs to</p>
<div class=mycode>
puts&nbsp;"The&nbsp;ancestors&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;String&nbsp;class&nbsp;are&nbsp;#{String.ancestors}"<br/>
<span style='color: red'>#&nbsp;Output&nbsp;->&nbsp;[String,&nbsp;Comparable,&nbsp;Object,&nbsp;Kernel,&nbsp;BasicObject]</span>
</div></li>
</ul>

<p>And it ends.</p>
