# What's Next?

Hey, congrats on finishing this level! We covered the following basic in Level 1:

* [What is Programming](introduction_to_programming.html)?
  * It's _control_ and _data_.
* [How does "data" work](data_and_variables.html)?
  * Pieces of data are referred to by _variables_.
* What is "control flow"?
  * Control flow is how your application is written in the vocabulary
    of a specific programming language.
  * Most programming languages let you define "functions" or _methods_
    that are little bits of control flow that you can repeatedly
    execute.
* What is OO programming?
  * In OO programming, we orient around "data" or _objects_. 
  * Control is usually executed via methods that are attached to the objects.
* What are blocks?
  * Blocks are another way of expressing bits of control flow, and are
    also referred to as _anonymous methods_.

# So what happens now?

We glossed over a lot of little things, that we'll address in lesson 2:

* What was up with the **::** notation in the "yellow pages" module?
  * This has something to do with how _namespaces_ work.
* What was the `attr_accessor` stuff all about?
  * Here's the technical explanation, which we'll learn more about:
    methods are the only publicly accessible properties of an object,
    in Ruby. 
* How about all those questions you asked about object oriented programming?
  * Want to know what "Multiple Inheritance" and "Eigenfunctions" mean?

It'll be fun, guaranteed!

# Good Bye
Thanks for listening!
