<h1 id="toc_0">Putting Together Code</h1>

<p>In programming, bits of code are usually put together so that it&rsquo;s
easy to repeatedly use them. The most typical format in which this is
done is by creating <em>functions</em>. A <em>function</em> has a name (just like
variables do) and will have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Zero or more arguments (very much like how your Ruby program can take in arguments from the command line)</li>
<li>A single return value</li>
</ul>

<p>In Ruby, functions are called <em>methods</em> and are created or defined using the <code>def</code> keyword:</p>
<div class=mycode>
def&nbsp;say_hello(name)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;puts&nbsp;"Hello,&nbsp;#{name}"<br/>
end
</div>

<h1 id="toc_1">Gems, Beautiful Gems</h1>

<p>Most languages will provide collections of commonly-used methods -
code to read files, for example, or to do trig calculations. These collections of methods are called a variety of names - libraries, modules, plugins, and so on. </p>

<p>Ruby calls these collections of methods, <em>gems</em>. Gems usually contain
more than just methods but we&rsquo;ll look into that later.</p>

<p>There is a set of methods that come &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo;: manipulating
arrays and hashes, reading files and directories, reading

<a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Regular.html">expressions</a>, generating
random numbers, managing processes and threads, and doing math, among
other things.</p>

<h1 id="toc_2">Execution Of Code</h1>

<p>Ruby is an <em>interpreted</em> language. This is typically used to mean that
will be executed at the same time that it is read; in other words, if
a part of the program is never read, it will never generate errors. In
contrast, in a <em>compiled</em> language the entire program is first read
and then executed - this way, certain types of errors in the program
can be detected before it&rsquo;s ever executed. For example, in a compiled
language, you cannot use a variable on the right side of an <code>=</code> sign
unless it has already been defined. Some interpreted languages will
allow you to do so, if the code that has the undefined variable is
never actually read during execution.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Interpretation In Ruby</h2>

<p>Ruby is somewhat stricter than other interpreted languages, like Python and Perl:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Python and Perl won&rsquo;t look at any code until it actually has to be
run. If you write an <code>if</code> condition and the condition you&rsquo;re
checking for is false, then anything inside the <code>if</code> block can have
undefined variables, and it won&rsquo;t matter to Python and Perl
interpreters.</p></li>
<li><p>Perl, by default, doesn&rsquo;t even require that variables be defined
when they are substituted. If it encounters an undefined variable,
it treats it like an empty string for most purposes. You have to run
Perl in &ldquo;strict mode&rdquo; to enforce it to not allow undefined variables to be used in code.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_4">Evaluating Statements</h1>

<p>Ruby will evaluate each line of code - called a <em>statement</em> - as it
goes along and will compute a return value for it. Every statement has
to have a return value, even if it&rsquo;s just the <code>nil</code> value.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Evaluating Along The Way</h2>

<p>In fact, Ruby gives you access to its evaluation via Ruby itself! That is, you can write a Ruby interpreter in Ruby, simply by using a built-in Ruby method called <code>eval</code></p>

<p>Look at this piece of code - what do you think the output is, when you save this to an <code>.rb</code> file and run it?</p>
<div class=mycode>
inner_code&nbsp;=&nbsp;"a=1;&nbsp;b=a+1"<br/>
c=eval(inner_code)<br/>
puts&nbsp;c+1
</div>

<p>If you guessed <strong>3</strong>, then you got it right! The <code>eval</code> function treated the value of the variable <code>inner_code</code> as Ruby code, and interpreted it. The result of that evaluation is the result of the final statement in <code>inner_code</code> - which is the value of <code>b</code>; which is <strong>2</strong>.</p>
