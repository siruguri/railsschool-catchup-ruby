<h1 id="toc_0">What&rsquo;s Next?</h1>

<p>Hey, congrats on finishing this level! We covered the following basic in Level 1:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="introduction_to_programming.html">What is Programming</a>?

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s <em>control</em> and <em>data</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="data_and_variables.html">How does &ldquo;data&rdquo; work</a>?

<ul>
<li>Pieces of data are referred to by <em>variables</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is &ldquo;control flow&rdquo;?

<ul>
<li>Control flow is how your application is written in the vocabulary
of a specific programming language.</li>
<li>Most programming languages let you define &ldquo;functions&rdquo; or <em>methods</em>
that are little bits of control flow that you can repeatedly
execute.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is OO programming?

<ul>
<li>In OO programming, we orient around &ldquo;data&rdquo; or <em>objects</em>. </li>
<li>Control is usually executed via methods that are attached to the objects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are blocks?

<ul>
<li>Blocks are another way of expressing bits of control flow, and are
also referred to as <em>anonymous methods</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_1">So what happens now?</h1>

<p>We glossed over a lot of little things, that we&rsquo;ll address in lesson 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>What was up with the <strong>::</strong> notation in the &ldquo;yellow pages&rdquo; module?

<ul>
<li>This has something to do with how <em>namespaces</em> work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What was the <code>attr_accessor</code> stuff all about?

<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s the technical explanation, which we&rsquo;ll learn more about:
methods are the only publicly accessible properties of an object,
in Ruby. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>How about all those questions you asked about object oriented programming?

<ul>
<li>Want to know what &ldquo;Multiple Inheritance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eigenfunctions&rdquo; mean?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be fun, guaranteed!</p>

<h1 id="toc_2">Good Bye</h1>

<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
