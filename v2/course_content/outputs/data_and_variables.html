<h1 id="toc_0">Naming Data</h1>

<p>To refer to pieces of data, programming languages use <em>variables</em>, which is the word for the names we give to data.</p>

<p>Most programming languages will have &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; support for a couple of simple data types, like integers and strings of text. They will also have a way to manage collections of data.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Simple Types in Ruby</h2>

<p>The simplest data types in Ruby are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Integers: Anything written as a number is assumed to be one, and you can perform most simple operations on them, for example, add, multiple, take the square of, and so on</p>
<div class=mycode>
a=3<br/>
b=a*2<br/>
puts&nbsp;b<br/>
<span style='color: blue'>6</span>
</div></li>
<li><p>Text: Text is usually represented by enclosing it in double- or single-quotes. In Ruby, you can concatenate string together using the <code>+</code> symbol.</p>
<div class=mycode>
first_name="Bill"<br/>
last_name='Clinton'<br/>
full_name=first_name&nbsp;+&nbsp;last_name<br/>
<span style='color: blue'>BillClinton</span>
</div></li>
</ul>

<p>In these examples, you can see how variable values are substituted and
assigned. The variable that is assigned to is on the left side of the
<code>=</code> symbol. Ruby will start by reading the expression to the right of
the <code>=</code> and &ldquo;compute&rdquo; it - that is, substitute values for the variable
names, and perform whatever operation is requested.</p>

<p>Note also that, like in most languages, variable names follow certain rules in Ruby:</p>

<ul>
<li>They can&rsquo;t contain spaces.</li>
<li>They can&rsquo;t start with numbers.</li>
<li>They usually only have alphanumeric characters and the underscore (&ldquo;_&rdquo;) character. (Any other characters in a variable name means that the data will behave in certain special ways so avoid using those characters until you&rsquo;ve learned what these special behaviors are.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2">Collections in Ruby</h2>

<p>Collections of data are simple ways of keeping related pieces of
information together, instead of having a new name for each one. For
example, if you have a roster of names that you are reading form a
file, then rather than have a separate variable for each name, you&rsquo;d
prefer to refer to them by a single variable that represents the
roster and then have them indexed by number.</p>

<p>There are two types of collections that are used in most languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Arrays: In Ruby, arrays are initialized using the <code>[ ]</code> symbol, like so:</p>
<div class=mycode>
names&nbsp;=&nbsp;['Hillary',&nbsp;'Bill',&nbsp;'Clinton']<br/>
president1&nbsp;=&nbsp;names[1]&nbsp;+&nbsp;names[2]<br/>
president2&nbsp;=&nbsp;names[0]&nbsp;+&nbsp;names[2]
</div>

<p>puts president1, president2
    ==&gt; BillClinton
    ==&gt; HillaryClinton</p></li>
<li><p>Hashes: Hashes are collections of <em>key/value pairs</em>. Each element in the hash is indexed by its key. In Ruby, hashes are initialized using the <code>{ }</code> symbol, like so:</p>
<div class=mycode>
clinton_family&nbsp;=&nbsp;{'mama-bear'&nbsp;=>&nbsp;'Hillary',&nbsp;'papa-bear'&nbsp;=>&nbsp;'Bill'}<br/>
clinton_family['baby-bear']&nbsp;=&nbsp;'Chelsea'<br/>
clinton_family['last-name']&nbsp;=&nbsp;'Clinton'<br/>
president1&nbsp;=&nbsp;clinton_family['papa-bear']&nbsp;+&nbsp;clinton_family['last-name']<br/>
president2&nbsp;=&nbsp;clinton_family['mama-bear']&nbsp;+&nbsp;clinton_family['last-name']
</div></li>
</ul>

<p>Note how the initialization uses different symbols, but both <code>Hash</code>es
and <code>Array</code>s use the <code>[ ]</code> symbols to assign individual values.</p>

<h1 id="toc_3">Advanced Topics</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>NIL</code></strong>: There is another simple data type in Ruby which is called <code>nil</code>. It represents nothing, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it is the same as an empty string or the number 0. It is typically used to denote that the behavior of something isn&rsquo;t as expected. For example, if you query a hash with a key that it doesn&rsquo;t contain, the return value is <code>nil</code>:</p>
<div class=mycode>
h1={:a=>5,:b=>6}<br/>
<span style='color: blue'>{:a=>5,&nbsp;:b=>6}</span><br/>
h1[:c]<br/>
<span style='color: blue'>nil</span>
</div></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic array re-sizing</strong>: You can assign values to any position in an array at any point; it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many items are in the array already. If you assign to a position that is past the current end of the array, the intermediate </p>
<div class=mycode>
arr1&nbsp;=&nbsp;[1,'a',6,'cde']<br/>
arr1[10]&nbsp;=&nbsp;5<br/>
puts&nbsp;arr1<br/>
<span style='color: blue'>[1,'a',6,'cde',nil,nil,nil,nil,nil,nil,5]</span>
</div></li>
</ul>
