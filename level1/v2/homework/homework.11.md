# Strings

The exercises in this set focus on learning how to manipulate strings. 

Strings in Ruby are represented by putting a sequence of characters
within either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). We will shortly
learn why these are different, but the lessons will begin by only
using double quotes.

The sequence of characters in a string can be manipulated
individually, as if they were members of an array. Similar to arrays,
the size of a string can be obtained using the method `.size`; each
character can be obtained using the `[]` operator, just as you do with
an array.
