# Introduction

The homeworks in this section require writing code to complete the
exercises, within the provided code samples. Each code sample (or
'program') already "works" - it will produce an output, and your
assignment in each program is to modify it per the instructions to change this output in some small way.

# Running the Programs

If you are using the command-line, you can run the programs by typing something like this at the command-line:

    your_shell_prompt > ruby sample_1.rb

If you are using an IDE like RubyMine, open each file in RubyMine and use the RubyMine commands as appropriate to run the file (usually, right click on the file and then select a Run option.)

You can thereby check your own answers - a successfully completed program will output the answer you want.

# How to Answer 

Each program comes with some sample data - however, your answer shouldn't work ONLY for that sample data set. It should be possible to change just the input data being used and still generate a correct response from the program.

# List of Programs

1. Check if odd or even
1. Check if positive or negative
1. Use a method to compute something we call 'parity'  
1. Figure out how to check if a variable is a string, using the `.class` method
1. Use `select` to return a subset of an array
