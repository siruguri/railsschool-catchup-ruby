# This exercise combines the previous one, with what you learned about defining methods.

fh = File.open("stats.csv")

# I want to count the lines in the file by passing the file handle to a method, like this - how do I do that?

# puts count_of_lines(fh)

# You have to define the method count_of_lines, which will be very similar to the code you wrote in Script 1.
