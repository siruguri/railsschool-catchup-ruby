# Let's combine many of the concepts we learned and write a series of
# methods, that each do one of the things we discussed. For this
# exercise, let's first write a method that tells us the size of all
# the files in a given folder.

def total_filesize_count(folder_name)

  # You will fill in something here. Remember that the method only
  # gets the folder name, not the folder handle. So the method needs
  # to first create the corresponding handle object.

end

# Let's try to use this method to get the size of all files in the current folder.
puts total_filesize_count(".")
