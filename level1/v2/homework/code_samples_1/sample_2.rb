# Ruby lets you check if a number is even or not, like this:

num = 6
check_even = num.even?

# If num is even, check_even will be true, else it's false.

puts check_even

# Your assignment is to use what you learned in lesson 1, and fill in
# the following so that you get true/false outputs for each item of
# the array odds_and_evens, depending on whether the number is odd or
# even - remember TRUE if it's odd and FALSE if it's even.

odds_and_evens = [9, 6, 19, 100, 41, 32, 19, 56]

# What will you fill in here? You will have to fill the blanks between the double-* symbols and then uncomment the lines

odds_and_evens.each do |i|
#  if ** some condition ** then
#     puts ** something **
#  end
  
end
