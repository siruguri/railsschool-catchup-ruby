# Introduction

The homeworks in this section also require writing code, as in the previous section. All the instructions are the same - use the hints in the code samples, and also use what you have learned from the samples in Homework 9.

# Manipulation of Directories and Files 

In these code samples, you will mainly be focusing on how to manipulate the _filesystem_ using Ruby. The two main classes you will familiarize yourself with are `File` and `Dir`. Each has a list of methods that allows for the manipulation of files and folders.

The documentation for these is available online:
* [`File`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/File.html)
* [`Dir`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Dir.html)

In some of the code samples, you will need to refer to this documentation, so keep it handy!

In some of the scripts we write, we will use a file called stats.csv for
analysis. If you name this file differently on your machine, then make
sure to change the corresponding name of the file in your scripts.

Note that this is a _text file_ - this homework set will only deal with reading text files, where each line in the file is separated by a _newline_, that is, each line in the file starts at the left side of the screen.

Good luck!
